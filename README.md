This is a reproduction on the paper "(Re-)Imag(in)ing Price Trends", where the time series data is transformed into 2-dimension pictures and then analyzed by the CNN neural network.

"generate pic label.py" draws OHLC pictures from time series data using numpy arrays.

"cnn_stock.py" establishes and trains the CNN model, and finally generates a table of probability for bullish trends in all stocks.
